# Data_Science_4th_Yr_Group_Project
Data Science Group Project

The initial goal of this project was to use data science and machine learning to predict the impact of air pollution on deaths, fertility rates and life expectancy.
The main idea for the project was to analyse the air quality in different regions across the world and compare the impact that it has on deaths, fertility rates and the life expectancy of those impacted and to analyse the data to show what impact air pollution is causing.

During the implementation of the project, the CRISP-DM hierarchical process model was used to apply each phase of the model to the project. 
The CRISP-DM model life cycle consists of six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modelling, Evaluation and Deployment. 

Upon completion of analysis of the data the information gathered was hoped to provide insights into the main causes of the issues relating to air pollution and that predictions as to how these trends will continue in the future and how they may be mitigated would also be provided.

The main objectives of the project were to:
1. Gain knowledge about machine learning.
2. Generate datasets from the raw data and apply machine learning algorithms.
3. Gain an understanding into how to apply the CRISP-DM process model to a data science project.
4. Discover insights into the impact of air pollution on deaths, fertility rates and life expectancy in different regions around the globe.
5. Demonstrate patterns found and correlations between the datasets using visualisation techniques.
6. Make future predictions using the machine learning algorithms that demonstrate how the impact of pollution may be mitigated
